Heading capitalization: Use sentence-style capitalization for all headings (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns). Example: "Creating a new user" not "Creating a New User."
Parenthetical plurals: Do not use constructions like "parameter(s)" or "option(s)." Instead, use either singular or plural form based on context.

Spelling: Use American English spelling conventions (e.g., "color" not "colour").
